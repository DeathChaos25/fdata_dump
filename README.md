# Koei Tecmo fdata file dump/extractor

This is a tool used to extract/dump files from Koei Tecmo games fdata archive format.
(Note: Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is currently not supported/tested)

Usage: Drag and Drop the folder containing all the fdata files into the tool's exe, and it will start the extraction process, please note that depending on the game/your HDD speeds this process can take up anywhere up to 2-3 hours on big games and slow HDDs!  
  

Currently Confirmed working games:
  - Fate/Samurai Remnant
  - Fairy Tail 2
  - Dynasty Warriors: Origin


(Note: Just because the game has not been tested and confirmed working does not mean it will not work, unless explicitly stated otherwise)
